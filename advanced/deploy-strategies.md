# Deploy strategies

### Single server

In most cases you don't need more than one production server.
It's better to build your release files (such as cache, js/css bundles) on the machine as well. 
So your build does not depend on your local configuration and can be deployed from everywhere.
By default deployer recipes designed to fullfill this kind of deployments.  

~~~php
desc('Deploy your project');
task('deploy', [
    'deploy:prepare',
    'deploy:release',
    'deploy:update_code',
    'deploy:shared',
    'deploy:vendors',
    'deploy:symlink',
]);
~~~

### Build server

If you have a lot of servers where are you going to deploy your application, or you are going to use CI server,
it's better to build release on one server and upload files to application servers.

To do that create a _build_ local task:

~~~php
task('build', function () {
    run('composer install');
    run('npm install');
    run('npm run build');
    // ...
})->local();
~~~

> Note, you can use simple task definition too
> ~~~php
> task('build', '
>     composer install
>     npm install
>     npm run build    
>     ...        
> ');
> ~~~

After create an _upload_ task:

~~~php
task('upload', function () {
    upload(__DIR__, '{{release_path}}');
});
~~~


Next, create release and deploy tasks:

~~~php
task('release', [
    'deploy:prepare',
    'deploy:release',
    'upload',
    'deploy:shared',
    'deploy:writable',
    'deploy:symlink',
]);

task('deploy', [
    'build',
    'release',
    'cleanup',
    'success'
]);
~~~

Now you can run `dep deploy` command.

### Reuse common recipe

If you want to reuse some tasks from common recipe, make sure what you set `deploy_path` before tasks invoking.
All common recipe tasks relying on this parameter.

~~~php
task('build', function () {
    set('deploy_path', __DIR__ . '/.build');
    invoke('deploy:prepare');
    invoke('deploy:release');
    invoke('deploy:update_code');
    invoke('deploy:vendors');
    // Add more build steps here
    invoke('deploy:symlink');
})->local();
~~~

> Make sure what you set `deploy_path` before tasks invoking.

After create an upload task:

~~~php
task('upload', function () {
    upload(__DIR__ . "/.build/current/", '{{release_path}}');
});
~~~

This task takes content from current symlink of `deploy_path` from build step and uploads to application `release_path` path.
